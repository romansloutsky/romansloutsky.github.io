I am interested in how protein sequence encodes protein function and
functional specificity in protein families. Dissecting how relatively
small differences in amino acid sequence among members of protein
families determine functional specificity will allow us to develop a
detailed understanding of how function is encoded in those families.
We can apply this understanding in designing proteins, developing better
models for systems biology, and in synthetic biology.

To investigate functional specificity in detail, I combine evolutionary
reconstruction and functional analysis, molecular modeling and simulation,
and experimental characterization function and functional specificity.
